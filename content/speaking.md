You can view some of my talks in a playlist I put together that can be accessed on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEhS0sTfXsRy6LnnbtGOvgbBAvOFSqEWT).

## Upcoming

I decided to take a "speaking-sabatycal" in 2020 to spend more time with the family and focus at my new role as CTO. Due to the COVID-19 and the growth in online events, I am considering speaking again...
